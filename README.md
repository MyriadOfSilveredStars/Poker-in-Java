# Poker-in-Java
As a way to practice both Java programming skills and probability calculations, I implemented a very basic poker game.

Features:
- At the start of the round, the player is given a randomly generated hand of cards
- Bots are also generated hands
- Each player and the bots begin with a certain number of chips with which to play with
- Normal rules of poker apply, with bots calculating the odds of a player's hand so as to call their bluff, fold, or raise

Notes:
- Bots are not entirely implemented and can be a bit buggy (such as always folding or calling bluff)
- Still working out the probability boundaries for a bot to calculate their move

Future Implementation:
- I'd like to make it a graphical game, not just text-based
